# CARLA camera publisher

C++ ROS node for publishing camera images via ROS image transport.

This project solves the problem of high camera bandwidth requirements
between CARLA server and client when they run on different hosts. For
example, a camera producing 640x360 images at 50 FPS requires
bandwidth around 400 Mbit/s. When the server is shared by multiple
users, this can easily lead to saturation of 1Â Gbit/s Ethernet links,
causing various problems and slowing down the simulation.

ROS [image_transport][] can compress camera frames as JPEGs or h264
stream (when using [ffmpeg_image_transport][]), which significantly
reduces the bandwidth.

## Features

- Survives CARLA restarts, map changes and ego vehicle respawning.
- Camera position and other parameters are modifiable at runtime via
  ROS parameters.
- Publishes TF2 transformations to allow overlaying 3D objects over
  the video, e.g. in Foxglove.
- Tested with CARLA 0.9.15 and 0.10.0 and ROS Jazzy Jalisco.
- Incompatible with `rviz2` (unfortunately) until [image_transport
  support is added](https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/1288).

## Usage

Store the source code to your [ROS 2 workspace][ROS tutorial] and
compile it with:

    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash

Then run the node as follows:

    ros2 run carla_camera_publisher carla_camera_publisher localhost 2000 --ros-args -p topic:=/my_camera

If you run CARLA with non-default port, use it instead of 2000.

The node will wait for the ego vehicle, create a camera sensors and
start publishing images from the camera on the following topics
(their number and names can differ depending on image_transport
plugins you have available):

    /my_camera
    /my_camera/compressed
    /my_camera/compressedDepth
    /my_camera/ffmpeg
    /my_camera/foxglove
    /my_camera/theora
    /my_camera/zstd

To access the video from another host, run:

    export ROS_STATIC_PEERS=aa.bb.cc.dd  # IP address of the host running CARLA
    ros2 node list
    ros2 launch ...

If `ros2 node list` doesn't show `carla_camera_publisher`, try running
`ros2 daemon stop` and ensure that the ROS traffic is not blocked by a
firewall.

### Streaming to Foxglove Studio

If you install [foxglove_compressed_video_transport][], you can stream
hardware-accelerated video directly to Foxglove. The following
parameters give good results for me with an NVIDIA GPU:

    ros2 run carla_camera_publisher carla_camera_publisher localhost 2000 --ros-args \
        -p width:=1920 -p height:=1080 \
        -p carla_camera_publisher.camera.foxglove.encoding:=h264_nvenc \
        -p carla_camera_publisher.camera.foxglove.preset:=ll \
        -p carla_camera_publisher.camera.foxglove.bit_rate:=30000000

To see the video in Foxglove run:

    export ROS_STATIC_PEERS=aa.bb.cc.dd  # IP address of the host running CARLA
    ros2 run foxglove_bridge foxglove_bridge

and connect Foxglove to `ws://localhost:8765`.
